# Israa Skah — Polished Portfolio (Starter)

This enhanced starter site includes:
- A diplomatic, professional tone in the text.
- A framed portrait area (replace `profile.jpg`).
- Achievements gallery with lightbox (replace `achievement-1.jpg`, `achievement-2.jpg`, ...).
- Responsive, accessible layout with improved typography and color palette.

Files
- index.html — main page (updated)
- styles.css — visual styles and layout
- script.js — gallery lightbox
- resume.pdf — (optional) put your CV here for download
- profile.jpg — (place your portrait file here)
- achievement-1.jpg, achievement-2.jpg, ... — achievement/event photos or scanned certificates

How to customize quickly
1. Portrait: replace `profile.jpg` with your headshot (1600×1600 or similar crop works well).
2. Achievements: add images named `achievement-1.jpg`, `achievement-2.jpg`, etc. Update or remove <button class="thumb"> elements in `index.html` if you have fewer or more images.
3. Text edits: open `index.html` and edit the sections (About, Experience, Education) directly.
4. Deploy:
   - GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages (root or /docs).
   - Vercel/Netlify: connect the repo and deploy automatically.
   - Local test: run a simple static server or open `index.html` in a browser (for the lightbox to load images consistently use a server).

Accessibility & best practices
- Images include alt text; maintain descriptive alt text when you replace images.
- Use descriptive file names for certificates (e.g., "UNICEF_Speaking_Sept2024.jpg") if you want better SEO and organization.

If you want, I can next:
- generate a two-page downloadable CV (PDF) formatted from this content;
- convert this into a small Next.js starter and push to a GitHub repo (tell me owner/repo);
- create a French language toggle and produce a bilingual version.

Tell me which of those you want and I will prepare it.
