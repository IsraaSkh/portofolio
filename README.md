# Israa Skah — Portfolio (Starter)

This is a simple single-page portfolio built from the information you provided. It includes sections for presentation, diplomas & certificates, professional experience, volunteer work, speaking, languages, interests, and contact information.

Files included:
- index.html — main single-page site
- styles.css — basic responsive styles
- (Optional) resume.pdf — add your resume PDF to the same folder and keep the filename `resume.pdf` so the Download link works

How to use
1. Edit content
   - Open index.html and update any text, dates, or sections.
   - Replace the placeholder contact details or address if needed.

2. Add images
   - Add a profile headshot or event photos to the folder and reference them in index.html.

3. Deploy
   - GitHub Pages: push this folder to a repository and enable Pages (use main branch / root). Your site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>.
   - Vercel / Netlify: connect the repo and deploy (automatic on push).
   - For quick local test: open index.html in a browser.

Suggestions to improve
- Add project or case study pages for major talks, events, or campaigns with images and links.
- Add downloadable certificates or an interactive timeline of achievements.
- Add analytics (Plausible/GA) and a contact form (Netlify Forms or simple mailto).
- Translate the page to French and provide language switch if you target francophone audiences.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a two-page downloadable resume PDF from this content.
- Convert this to a Next.js or Jekyll template and push a starter repo.
- Add a photo, color theme, or logo and produce finished deployable files.

Tell me which of those you'd like next and I will prepare it.
